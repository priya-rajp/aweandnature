      <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        Awe is a powerful emotion that blends wonder, respect, and even a touch of fearâ€”triggered by experiences that feel vast or profound. Itâ€™s not just joy; itâ€™s an expansive feeling that alters your perception and stretches your mental boundaries. Psychologists describe awe as arising from two key factors: <strong>perceived vastness</strong> and a <strong>need for cognitive accommodation</strong>â€”our mind reshaping itself to comprehend something extraordinary.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        Nature is one of the most reliable sources of aweâ€”from starry skies and towering trees to quiet lakes and sweeping vistas. These moments of awe ground us, expand our awareness, and enhance our wellbeing.

    <h2>ðŸŒŸ What is Awe?</h2>
    <p>
      Awe is a powerful emotion that blends amazement, reverence, and wonder. It's triggered by experiences of vastnessâ€”like a starry sky or a towering mountainâ€”and causes a shift in our thinking. According to researchers Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt, awe involves perceiving something immense and needing to adjust our mental models to understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike joy or surprise, awe often makes us feel smallâ€”in a good wayâ€”connecting us to something larger than ourselves. Nature is one of the most common and potent sources of awe.
